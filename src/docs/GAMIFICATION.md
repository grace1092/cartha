# Gamification System Documentation

## Overview

The MoneyTalks gamification system is a comprehensive engagement platform designed to motivate couples to consistently participate in financial conversations while tracking their relationship alignment progress. The system uses psychological principles including progress tracking, achievement unlocking, social comparison, and positive reinforcement to drive sustained engagement.

## Core Components

### 1. Alignment Score System (0-100)

The alignment score represents how financially synchronized a couple is, calculated from multiple weighted factors:

#### Score Factors & Weights
- **Communication Alignment (20%)**: How well they discuss money topics
- **Financial Values Match (18%)**: Alignment on core financial beliefs
- **Goal Compatibility (16%)**: How well their financial goals work together
- **Spending Harmony (15%)**: Agreement on spending decisions
- **Future Planning Sync (12%)**: Coordination on long-term plans
- **Conflict Resolution (10%)**: How they resolve money disagreements
- **Transparency Level (5%)**: Openness about finances
- **Session Consistency (4%)**: Regular engagement with the platform

#### Scoring Algorithm
```typescript
// Base compatibility scoring
const compatibility = calculateResponseCompatibility(questionType, userAnswer, partnerAnswer);

// Apply session bonuses
const bonusScore = applySessionBonuses(
  baseScore,
  completionRate,
  sessionDuration,
  plannedDuration,
  currentStreak
);

// Calculate weighted overall score
const overallScore = calculateOverallScore(factors, weights);
```

### 2. Streak Tracking System

Tracks consecutive engagement to build habits and momentum:

#### Streak Types
- **Session-based**: Consecutive money date completions
- **Daily**: Daily platform engagement
- **Weekly**: Weekly goal achievement

#### Features
- **Grace Period**: 24-hour window to maintain streak if missed
- **Streak Freeze**: Vacation mode to pause streak counting
- **Visual Fire Animation**: Intensity scales with streak length
- **Milestone Celebrations**: Special recognition at 7, 14, 30, 100+ days

### 3. Achievement & Badge System

Multi-tier recognition system to celebrate progress:

#### Badge Rarities
- **Common**: Basic milestones (first session, 7-day streak)
- **Rare**: Significant achievements (30-day streak, 80+ score)
- **Epic**: Major accomplishments (90+ score, 100-day streak)
- **Legendary**: Exceptional feats (perfect score, year-long streak)

#### Achievement Categories
- **Getting Started**: First-time achievements
- **Consistency**: Streak and regularity rewards
- **Improvement**: Score progression milestones
- **Milestone**: Major threshold celebrations
- **Special**: Seasonal or event-based achievements

### 4. Progress Analytics
